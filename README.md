# RSA-Algorithm

RSA is a type of asymmetric encryption, which uses two different but linked keys. 
In RSA cryptography, both the public and the private keys can encrypt a message. 
The public key is used to encrypt a message while the private key is used to decrypt it.

<b>Using Python programming Language for demonstration</b><br><br>
The generate.py files follows procedures for generating public and private key.<br>
The encrypt.py file performs encryption and saves values in a text file.  It gets the ASCII values of characters and encrypts that value.<br>
The decrypt.py file gets the contents of the encrypted file and decrypts the values using the public and private key.
